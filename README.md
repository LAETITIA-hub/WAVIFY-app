# Wavify App

## Project Description
Wavify is a web application designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable music listening experience. With Wavify, users can listen to free music with unlimited skips, enjoy an ad-free environment, and play tracks in any order they choose. The app supports all genres of music, allows users to create unlimited playlists, and offers the ability to download full tracks for offline listening. Wavify also includes social features, enabling users to create "jams" with others to explore diverse music genres and share their favorite tunes.

## Project MVP
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Wavify includes the following core features:
- **Search and Filter Music**: Users can search and filter music by genre, artist, and lyrics to quickly find their favorite tracks.
- **Join Jams**: Users can join music "jams" created by friends to discover new songs and collaborate on shared listening experiences.
- **Leading Music Trends**: Users can view trending music to stay up-to-date with popular tracks and artists.
- **Exquisite Playlists**: Users can explore beautifully curated playlists tailored to various tastes and moods.

## Public API Used
- **json-server**: A lightweight and easy-to-use API for persisting and managing music data, playlists, and user preferences during development.
